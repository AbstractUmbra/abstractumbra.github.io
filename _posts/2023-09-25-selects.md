Welcome, this post is about the different types of select menus and how to use them.

You can [view them in the discord.py docs](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/interactions/api.html#select-menus).

## Select

(technically called a "string select")
This is the most basic select menu. It allows the user to select from a list of up to 25 custom options.

**Example:**
{% highlight python %}
from typing import Any

import discord
from discord.ui import Select


class FruitSelect(Select):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__(
            placeholder="Select a favorite fruit...",
            # the options
            options=[
                # value is what is returned when the option is selected, label is what is shown to the user
                # value is optional; if not provided, the label is used as the value
                discord.SelectOption(label="Apple", value="apple"),
                discord.SelectOption(label="Orange", value="orange"),
                discord.SelectOption(label="Banana", value="banana"),
            ]
        )

    async def callback(self, interaction: discord.Interaction) -> Any:
        selected_fruit: str = self.values[0] # either "apple", "orange" or "banana"
        await interaction.response.send_message(
            f"{interaction.user.mention}'s favorite fruit is {selected_fruit}!"
        )
{% endhighlight %}

Sending that as a view will result in a select menu that looks like this:
![string_select](\static\images\selects\string_select.png)

## Auto-populated selects

*discord.py v2.1+ required*

These are select menus that are populated automatically by Discord; they are not *really* customizable:

- You cannot filter the members, roles, or channels shown.
- You can set the minimum and maximum amount of options a user can or must select using the `min_values` (1-25) and `max_values` (1-25) kwargs.
- You can choose the types of channels shown for [`ChannelSelect`](#channelselect).
- You can set the options that should be selected by default using the [`default_values`](#default_values) kwarg. (*requires discord.py v2.4+*)
- Only the first 25 options will be shown; the rest can be found by searching in the search bar, which has autocomplete.
- These cannot be used in modals. (*requires discord.py v2.6+*)

### UserSelect

This is a select menu that allows the user to select from a list of members in the server or, if used in a DM, you and the bot.

We import and use `UserSelect` instead of `Select`:
{% highlight python %}
from discord.ui import UserSelect
{% endhighlight %}
And [`values`](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/interactions/api.html#discord.ui.UserSelect.values) is a list of [`discord.Member`](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api.html#member) or [`discord.User`](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api.html#user) objects:
{% highlight python %}
from typing import Any

import discord


class RandomUserSelect(UserSelect):
    async def callback(self, interaction: discord.Interaction) -> Any:
        users: list[discord.Member | discord.User] = self.values
        selected_users = [
            f"Name: {user.name}, ID: {user.id}"
            for user in users
        ]
        await interaction.response.send_message(
            f"{interaction.user.mention} selected the following users:\n" + "\n".join(selected_users)
        )
{% endhighlight %}

## RoleSelect

This is a select menu that allows the user to select from a list of roles in the server.

We import and use `RoleSelect`:
{% highlight python %}
from discord.ui import RoleSelect
{% endhighlight %}
And [`values`](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/interactions/api.html#discord.ui.RoleSelect.values) is a list of [`discord.Role`](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api.html#role) objects:
{% highlight python %}
from typing import Any

import discord


class RandomRoleSelect(RoleSelect):
    async def callback(self, interaction: discord.Interaction) -> Any:
        roles: list[discord.Role] = self.values
        selected_roles = [
            f"Name: {role.name}, ID: {role.id}"
            for role in roles
        ]
        await interaction.response.send_message(
            f"{interaction.user.mention} selected the following roles:\n" + "\n".join(selected_roles)
        )
{% endhighlight %}

### MentionableSelect

This is a select menu that allows the user to select from a list of members and roles in the server or, if used in a DM, you and the bot.

We import and use `MentionableSelect`:
{% highlight python %}
from discord.ui import MentionableSelect
{% endhighlight %}

And [`values`](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/interactions/api.html#discord.ui.MentionableSelect.values) is a list of [`discord.Member`](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api.html#member), [`discord.User`](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api.html#user) and [`discord.Role`](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api.html#role) objects:
{% highlight python %}
from typing import Any

import discord


class RandomMentionableSelect(MentionableSelect):
    async def callback(self, interaction: discord.Interaction) -> Any:
        mentionables: list[discord.Member | discord.User | discord.Role] = self.values
        selected_users = [
            f"Name: {user.name}, ID: {user.id}"
        for user in mentionables
        if isinstance(user, (discord.Member, discord.User))
    ]
    selected_roles = [
        f"Name: {role.name}, ID: {role.id}"
        for role in mentionables
        if isinstance(role, discord.Role)
    ]
    await interaction.response.send_message(
        (
            f"{interaction.user.mention} selected the following users:\n" + "\n".join(selected_users)
            f"\nand the following roles:\n" + "\n".join(selected_roles)
        )

    )
{% endhighlight %}

### ChannelSelect

This is a select menu that allows the user to select from a list of channels in the server.

We import and use `ChannelSelect`, and we can use the `channel_types` kwarg to limit the types of channels shown; by default, all types of channels are shown:
{% highlight python %}
from discord import ChannelType
from discord.app_commands import AppCommandChannel, AppCommandThread
from discord.ui import ChannelSelect
{% endhighlight %}

And [`values`](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/interactions/api.html#discord.ui.ChannelSelect.values) is a list of [`discord.AppCommandChannel`](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/interactions/api.html#appcommandchannel) or [`discord.AppcommandThread`](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/interactions/api.html#appcommandthread) objects:
{% highlight python %}
from typing import Any

import discord


class ChannelsSelector(ChannelSelect):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__(
            placeholder="Select a channel...",
            # limit the type of channels shown to text, voice and threads
            channel_types=[ChannelType.text, ChannelType.voice, ChannelType.thread]

    async def callback(self, interaction: discord.Interaction) -> Any:
        channels: list[AppCommandChannel | AppCommandThread] = self.values
        selected_channels = [
            f"Name: {channel.name}, ID: {channel.id}"
            for channel in channels
        ]
        await interaction.response.send_message(
            f"{interaction.user.mention} selected the following channels:\n" + "\n".join(selected_channels)
        )
{% endhighlight %}

### default_values

*discord.py v2.4+ required*

You can specify the options that should be selected by default using the `default_values` kwarg.

The kwarg takes a list of objects, the type of which depends on the type of select menu; e.g., for a `ChannelSelect`, it would be a list of channel objects.

There is also a special class for it called [`SelectDefaultValue`](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/interactions/api.html#selectdefaultvalue), which takes the `id` of a user, role, or channel and the [`type`](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api.html#discord.SelectDefaultValueType) of the object. You can also use the `from_user`, `from_role`, and `from_channel` classmethods to create the object. This can be used for all types of selects, except for (string) `Select`.

{% highlight python %}
from typing import Any

import discord
from discord import ui


class ChooseAnyoneExceptMe(ui.View):
    def __init__(self, bot_owner_id: int):
        super().__init__()

        # set the default values of the user select to the bot owner, so they can't select me!
        self.user_select.default_values = [
            discord.SelectDefaultValue(id=bot_owner_id, type=discord.SelectDefaultType.user)
        ]

    @ui.select(cls=ui.UserSelect, placeholder="Select my owner...")
    async def user_select(self, interaction: discord.Interaction, select: ui.UserSelect) -> Any:
        selected_user = select.values[0]
        # yes, we are very sure that the selected user is not the bot owner.
        await interaction.response.send_message(
            f"{selected_user.mention} is not my owner!"
        )

{% endhighlight %}

## Decorator

The select menus can also be defined using a decorator in a `View`/`LayoutView` subclass by specifying the `cls` kwarg (defaults to `Select`):
{% highlight python %}
from typing import Any

import discord
from discord import ui


class SelectView(ui.View):
    # string select
    # @ui.select(placeholder="Select an option...". options=[...])
    # or @ui.select(cls=ui.Select, placeholder="Select an option...". options=[...])

    # user select
    # @ui.select(cls=ui.UserSelect, placeholder="Select a user...")
    # role select
    # @ui.select(cls=ui.RoleSelect, placeholder="Select a role...")
    # mentionable select
    # @ui.select(cls=ui.MentionableSelect, placeholder="Select a role or user...")

    # channel select
    # only text, voice and threads are shown
    @ui.select(cls=ui.ChannelSelect, channel_types=[ChannelType.text, ChannelType.voice, ChannelType.thread], placeholder="Select a channel...")
    async def channel_select(self, interaction: discord.Interaction, select: ui.ChannelSelect) -> Any:
        ...

{% endhighlight %}

When using a [discord.ui.LayoutView](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/interactions/api.html#discord.ui.LayoutView), you are required to specify a [discord.ui.ActionRow](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/interactions/api.html#discord.ui.ActionRow), but everything else works the same:
{% highlight python %}
from typing import Any

from discord import ui


class SelectView(ui.LayoutView):
    select_action_row = ui.ActionRow()

    # string select
    # @select_action_row.select(placeholder="Select an option...". options=[...])
    # or @select_action_row.select(cls=ui.Select, placeholder="Select an option...". options=[...])

    # user select
    # @select_action_row.select(cls=ui.UserSelect, placeholder="Select a user...")
    # role select
    # @select_action_row.select(cls=ui.RoleSelect, placeholder="Select a role...")
    # mentionable select
    # @select_action_row.select(cls=ui.MentionableSelect, placeholder="Select a role or user...")

    # channel select
    # only text, voice and threads are shown
    @select_action_row.select(cls=ui.ChannelSelect, channel_types=[ChannelType.text, ChannelType.voice, ChannelType.thread], placeholder="Select a channel...")
    async def channel_select(self, interaction: discord.Interaction, select: ui.ChannelSelect) -> Any:
        ...

{% endhighlight %}

The same applies when in a [discord.ui.ActionRow](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/interactions/api.html#discord.ui.ActionRow) or [discord.ui.Container](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/interactions/api.html#discord.ui.Container) subclass.


## Select in Modal
As of discord.py v2.6, you can use select menus in modals.

This can be useful for gathering user input in a more interactive way. Here's an example of how to use a string select in a modal. All the types of selects are supported.

We need to use the [discord.ui.Label](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/interactions/api.html#discord.ui.Label) component here.

Good to note:
- The total number of options is the same as outside of a modal (25).
- The total number of components in a modal is (still) 5.
- This is the only time the `required` kwarg for selects is valid.
- The `disabled` kwarg for selects is not supported atm and will raise an error if used inside a modal.

{% highlight python %}
from typing import Any

import discord
from discord import ui


class ModalWithSelect(ui.Modal):
    # defining a Label with the component set to a Select
    fruit_select = ui.Label(
        text="Your favorite fruit",
        # setting an optional description
        # this will appear below the label on desktop, and below the component on mobile
        description="Please select your favorite fruit from the list.",
        # this is where a select (or TextInput) component goes
        component=ui.Select(
            placeholder="Select your favorite fruit...", # this is optional
            # we can make it optional too using the required kwarg
            # defaults to True (required)
            required=True,
            options=[
                discord.SelectOption(label="Apple", value="apple"),
                discord.SelectOption(label="Banana", value="banana"),
                discord.SelectOption(label="Cherry", value="cherry"),
            ]
        )
    )

    # adding a TextInput for the sake of example
    reason = ui.Label(
        text="Why is that your favorite fruit?",
        component=ui.TextInput(
            placeholder="Tell us why...",
            # making this one optional -- we don't really need to know
            required=False
        )
    )

    # handling the submission
    async def on_submit(self, interaction: Interaction) -> None:
        # will be one of: "apple", "banana", "cherry"
        chosen_fruit = self.fruit_select.component.values[0]
        reason = self.reason.component.value
        
        # reason is optional so we can handle that here
        if not reason:
            reason = "*you didn't tell us why :(*"

        await interaction.response.send_message(
            f"Your favorite fruit is {chosen_fruit} because {reason}"
        )



{% endhighlight %}
